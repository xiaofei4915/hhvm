Description: Disable quicklz primitives.
 There are GPL code linked to PHP-licensed code in hhvm/runtime/ext/zlib.
 This is being used internally at Facebook for memcache compression but it's
 illegal to link those two code bases, so I'm disabling this for now in the
 builds.  It's very possible that I end up removing the GPL code altogether
 in the "dfsg1" releases for 3.3 and beyond.
